In order to execute this program, download calc.S and the makefile and move them to the same directory. Open the terminal and cd into that directory. Once there, execute the makefile by entering the command 'make all'. The program should have compiled successfully. Now enter into the terminal the command './calc' followed by a space and then an infix expression containing up to 4 operands with no spaces between any of the characters in the infix expression. After that, if you hit enter, the program will then evaluate the infix expression and return the result.
